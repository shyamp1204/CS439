  preparing your submission, other than the Linux documentation,
  course text, and lecture notes.

Questions regarding Part 0
################
(1) How many child processes are created when doFib() begins with
  an input of 5?  Show the return value for each child process, numbering
  the processes beginning with 0 (the original process) and incrementing for
  each child process.

14 child processes are created with "./fib 5"
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5

(2) In part 0.3, which flavor of exec did you choose to use?  Why?

execve();
We used execve() because it executes the program pointed to by "filename" argument and in the "argv[]" pointer in the parameters.
execve() doesn't return on success.  On an error, it returns -1 and errno is set.
This is the action that we desire when attempting to run an executeable file from the entered command line request.

################
Questions regarding Part 1
################
(1) In the provided utility function Signal(), what does the call to
  sigaction() do?  Why was sigaction() used instead of signal()?

the signal() function call is less portable than sigaction(), and also has unspecified effects when in a multithreaded process. 
Although they both allow the programmer to define how to handle each signal, signal() does not block other incomming signals, whereas 
sigaction() blocks other signals until the handler returns from the current signal.

(2) What is the last assembly language instruction executed by the
  signal handler function that you write?  (You may choose either signal
  handler.)

last 5 assembly instructions are(very last instruction indicated by "=>"):

   0x0000000000400a58 <+107>:   callq  0x4007b0 <exit@plt>
   0x0000000000400a5d <+112>:   mov    $0x1,%edi
   0x0000000000400a62 <+117>:   callq  0x4007b0 <exit@plt>
   0x0000000000400a67 <+122>:   leaveq 
=> 0x0000000000400a68 <+123>:   retq   



(3) After the instruction identified in the previous question executes, 
  what is the next assembly language instruction executed?

Next instruction indicated by "=>"

Dump of assembler code for function __nanosleep_nocancel:
   0x00007ffff7ad5f19 <+0>:     mov    $0x23,%eax
   0x00007ffff7ad5f1e <+5>:     syscall 
=> 0x00007ffff7ad5f20 <+7>:     cmp    $0xfffffffffffff001,%rax
   0x00007ffff7ad5f26 <+13>:    jae    0x7ffff7ad5f59 <nanosleep+73>


(4) When the signal handler finishes running, it must restore all of
  the registers from the interrupted thread to exactly their values
  before the signal occurred. How is this done?

The register values and any other necessary data are stored in a kernel data structure call the Process Control Block(pcb).
Once returned from the signal handler, the process can retrieve this data and continue execution from where it left off.

################
Questions regarding Part 2
################
(1) In msh.c, we use three separate signal handlers to catch our signals. 
  You can also use a single signal handler to catch all three signals.  Is
  there a design advantage of one over the other?  Explain your answer.

The design advantage in using seperate signal handlers is code readability.  The program was much easier to 
debug and understand which function wasn't working correctly based on which signal was being sent.  The system 
may take slightly longer to recognize which function should be called as a result of a signal being sent, 
relative to the time it takes to call a single signal handler to catch all 3 signals.
