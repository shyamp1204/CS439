---- PARTNER EVALUATION SCALE ----

>> Excellent: Consistently went above and beyond - tutored others, carried
>> more than his/her fair share of the load.

>> Very Good: Consistently did what he/she was supposed to do, very well
>> prepared and cooperative.

>> Satisfactory: Usually did what he/she was supposed to do, minimally
>> prepared and cooperative.

>> Marginal: Sometimes failed to show up and/or rarely prepared.

>> Deficient: Often failed to show up and/or rarely prepared.

>> Unsatisfactory: Consistently failed to show up and/or unprepared.

>> Superficial: Practically no participation.

>> No Show: No participation at all.


---- PRELIMINARIES ----

>> If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for the
>> TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

>> Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
>> preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation, course
>> text, lecture notes, and course staff.

			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

change from a busy wait method to ...

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

race conditions are avoided when multipled simultaneous thread calls are made by using ...

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?



---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?



			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art, a diagram, or a drawing to illustrate a nested 
>> donation.  (You may submit an additional file of type .png or .pdf
>> for this problem.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?



			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the two problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future semesters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
