1.
#value -> frequency
#12 = 94
#10 = 101
#87 = 118

2.
> time make
on Project0 files

real	0m0.583s
- time it took to actually compile and make the executeables
user	0m0.383s
- time it took to display the executeables to the current user
sys	0m0.115s
- time it took the system to recognize the command and start the compile

The time on each line in incrementally greater, which is what I would expect.

3. 
A program is a list of instructions telling the OS what to do
A process is an instance of a program that is being executed (contains the program code).  It is the basic unit of execution in an OS
An executeable is a file that has machine instructions for the OS on how to run a program. Executeables are used to run programs

4.
2 child and 2 parent processes.
3 different c's, however, when forked the child process uses the same memory location for the variable
child 1:  c=4
parent 1: c=6
- child 2: c=8


5.
Fairness and throughput can be competing goals for a scedular because in most instances, if the schedular is being more fair the throughput of the programs decreases.  The throughput can be high when the schedular is using a FIFO policy to execute smaller processes first.
A fair schedular make bad use of the CPU when a process continues to take time even when the process is waiting for I/O, memory, or an interrupt.  During this time, the process is simply waiting for a return and the CPU is idle.
A FCFS schedular policy has a high throughput, but is unfair because it runs processes that enter the queue first until they are completely finished.  This method has a high throughput but may not be fair to other processes waiting to use the CPU.
