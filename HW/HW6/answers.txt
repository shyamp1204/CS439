1.
Yes. Paging is vulnerable to internal fragmentation because page sizes are set, and processes don't always use the full amount of memory in the frame.
External fragmentation is very small if any in paging because pages are mapped to physical memory from virtual memory, not allowing any unused blocks between frames

2.
Smaller pages will help reduce internal fragmentation and allows more frames to be in physical memory at once.
Larger pages give programs a more memory to use, and better speed because there be less paging (less page faults / better locality)
Page sizes are growing in paging memory systems because memory is cheap and more of it is being put in each computers, and it avoids page faults more often.

Large pages wont need to load pages as often.

3.
resident bit - means it's resident in memory
clock/reference bit - accessed in the last clock rotation
dirty bit - been written to in memory

4.
The heap is dynamically allocated so it only uses as much memory as is needed at a certain time.
OS manages page sizes in chunks.

5.
No memory access to the swap area on the disk without a chache would take alot of time.  This cache helps find most recently run programs.  Page faults using this system would be very slow.
